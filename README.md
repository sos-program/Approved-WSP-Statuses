* DATA Folder:
* SPECS Folder: contains a csv file with the metric specifications set for each CU, as determined by CU experts, and relative abundance metric benchmarks where available. Also contains a csv file with relative abundance metric benchmarks for cyclic CUs by cycle line.
* CODE Folder: contains R scripts that install the WSPMetrics Package (Holt et al. 2025), calculate standard metrics for each CU according to the specifications provided in the spec file, apply the WSP status decision tree, and generate status dashboard plots.
* OUTPUT folder:
