Variable,Description
CU_ID,Unique and standardized identifier for each Pacific salmon Conservation Unit (CU)
CU_Acro,CU Acronym for dashboards
CU_Name,Full offical CU name
Group,"Group the CU belongs to, eg. Fraser Sockeye"
DataQualkIdx,"Data type, either Absolute Abundance (AbsAbd) or Relative Index (RelIdx)"
AbdMetric,If TRUE the relative abundance metric is calculated (as long as benchmarks are provided)
AbsAbdMetric,If TRUE the absolute abundance metric is calculated
ShortTrendMetric,If TRUE the short term trend/percent change metric is calculated
LongTrendMetric,If TRUE the long term trend metric is calculated
PercentileMetric,If TRUE the percentile metric is calculated (currently not used)
Avg_Gen,Average generation time in years
Cyclic,Does the CU display cyclic abundance patterns (e.g. some Fraser Sockeye CUs like Shuswap_ES)
Cyc_Dom,"If the CU is cyclic, which cycle line is dominant"
Cyc_Dom_Year,"If the CU is cyclic, which cycle line year is dominant (earliest relevant year in the data)"
TrendNumGen,Number of generations used to calculate the percent decline
TrendExtraYears,Provided if additional years of data are used in the percent decline metric
TrendLog,Log-transform data when calculating the percent change metric (TRUE/FALSE)
TrendSmooth,Use smoothed data when calculating the percent change metric (TRUE/FALSE)
AvgType,"Type of average to use in the long term trend (mean, geometric mean (geomean), median)"
AvgSmooth,Use smoothed data when calculating the long term trend metric (TRUE/FALSE)
AvgRecentExcl,Exclude the most recent generation in the long term average component of the long term trend metric (TRUE/FALSE)
LongTrendMinYears,Minimum number of years of data needed to calculate the long term trend metric
RelAbd_AvgData,Use 'regular' or 'smoothed' data when calculating the recent generation average in the relative and absolute abundance metrics. See notes in WSPMetrics package for more details.
